# Introduction

VuePress is a static site generator powered by Vue + markdown + webpack. It's focus on minimal setup, and markdown-centric architecture for generating docs has caught my attention so I decided to try it out.

This is a VuePress template I built for my personal website.
Check it out on [Github](https://github.com/strychemi/vuepress-strychemi).

The purpose of writing this is 3-fold:
  1. I get to practice documentating my work.
  2. I have something to help jog my memory once I forget how I built this.
  3. It may help other developers who may be interested in trying this out.

If this is your first exposure to VuePress, I highly recommend heading over to the [official VuePress documentation](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).

If you find any issues/errors/tips, feel free to open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/strychemi/vuepress-strychemi). Any feedback is appreciated.
